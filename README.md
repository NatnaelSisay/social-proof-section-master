## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)

### What I learned

Learned how to better organize my SASS files for better modularity.
And also how to break large user interface down to single pupose small component.

### Continued development

On some situations I haven't separated the Layout from the style and theme, which can be better improved.

### Useful resources

- [Sass Guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) - good understaing on how to organize sass files in multiple modules.
